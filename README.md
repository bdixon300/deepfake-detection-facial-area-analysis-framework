# vgg-lstm
The bulk of experiments were conducted using this repository. Once the dataset had been preprocessed and the frequency domain experiments were over. This code is where the VGG16 CNN models were experimented with, then the LRCN models and the late fusion. Finally, it is where the full dataset was trained and evaluated for the final deepfake detection solution.

One important note is that the code must run on GPU enabled hardware. This is encouraged because the process will be incredibly slow otherwise.
